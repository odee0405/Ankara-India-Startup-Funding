# Ankara-India-Startup-Funding
Analysis on India Startup Funding

## Introduction
For this project, we seek to analyse funding received by startups in India. The aim is to prescribe the best course of action for a startup looking into the Indian business ecosystem. Our first step will be to gain business understanding of the problem.

## Business Understanding
India has become an attractive location for investors and has seen a number of successful startups achieve the coveted "unicorn" status. To guide our quest for the best course of action as an upcoming startup, we asked a few questions which we will attempt to answer using the data on hand.

- Does the age of the  startup affect the funding received?
- Which sectors received the most funding?
- Does the number of founders affect the funding received?
- At what stage do startups receive the most funding?
- Does the location affect the funding received?
